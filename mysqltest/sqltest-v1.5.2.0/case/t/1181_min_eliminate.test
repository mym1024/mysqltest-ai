###2-1：只含单个聚合函数, 聚合列为主键列
select min(c1) from t1;

select min(c1) from t1 where c2 > 0;

select min(c1) from t1 where c2 > 0 and c3 > 0;

select min(c1) from t1 where c2 > 0 and c3 > 0 and c4 > 0;

select min(c1) as x from t1;


###2-2：只含单个聚合函数, 聚合列为索引列
select min(c2) from t1;

select min(c2) from t1 where c1 > 0;

select min(c2) from t1 where c2 > 0;

select min(c2) from t1 where c2 > 0 and c3 > 0;

select min(c2) from t1 where c2 > 0 and c3 > 0 and c4 > 0;

select min(c2) as x from t1;


###2-3：只含单个聚合函数, 聚合列为非主键索引列
select min(c4) from t1;

select min(c4) from t1 where c2 > 0;


###2-4：嵌套子查询最小聚合消除
select min(a) from (select min(c1) as a from t1) t1;

select * from (select a from (select min(c1) as a from t1) t1) t1;

select * from (select min(a) as x from (select min(c1) as a from t1) t1) t1;

select min(x) from (select min(a) as x from (select c1 as a from (select * from t1) t1) t1) t1;


###2-7：单个聚合函数+其他列, 聚合列为主键列
select min(c1), c2 from t1;

select min(c1), c2 as x from t1;

select min(c1), c2 from t1 where c2 > 0;

select min(c1), c2, c3 from t1 where c2 > 0;

select min(c1), c2, c3, c4 from t1 where c2 > 0;

select min(c1), c1, c1, c2, c2 from t1;

select c1, c1, min(c1), c2, c2 from t1;

select min(c1) as v, c1 as x, c1, c2, c2 as y from t1;

###2-8：单个聚合函数+其他列, 聚合列为索引列
select min(c2), c3 from t1;

select min(c2), c3 as x from t1 where c2 > 0;

select min(c2), c3 from t1 where c3 > 0;

select min(c2), c3, c4 from t1 where c4 > 0;

select min(c2), c1, c1, c2, c2 from t1;

select c1, c1, min(c2), c2, c2 from t1;

select min(c2) as v, c1 as x, c1, c2, c2 as y from t1;


###2-9：单个聚合函数+其他列，嵌套子查询最小聚合消除
select min(a) from (select min(c1) as a, c2, c3 from t1) t1;

select * from (select a from (select min(c1) as a, c2, c3 from t1) t1) t1;

select * from (select min(a) as x, c2 as w from (select min(c1) as a, c2, c3 from t1) t1) t1;


###2-12：增加limit 1， 最小聚合非隔层嵌套
select min(c1) from (select * from t1) t1;

select min(a) from (select min(c1) as a from (select c1, c2 from t1) t1) t1;

###2-13：增加limit 1， 最小聚合隔层嵌套
select x, min(b) from (select min(a) as x, b from (select c1 as a, c2 as b from (select * from t1) t1) t1) t1;

select x, min(b) from (select min(a) as x, b from (select c1 as a, c2 as b from (select c1, c2 from (select * from t1) t1) t1) t1) t1;

###2-14：消除union语句最小聚合
select min(c1) from t1 union select min(c2) from t1;

select min(c1), c2 from t1 union select min(c2), c3 from t1;

select min(c1) from t1 union select min(c2) from t1 union select min(c3) from t1;

select * from (select min(c1) from t1 union select min(c2) from t1 union select min(c3) from t1) t;


###2-15：不支持最小聚合消除的情况
select min(c1), count(*) from t1;

select min(c1) from t1 group by c2;

select /*+index(t1 idx1) */ min(c1) from t1 where c2 >0 and c3 > 0;

--error 7
select min(c1) from t1 where c1 = 1 for update;

select min(c1) from t1 limit 1;

select distinct min(c1) from t1;

select min(c1) from t1 order by c2;

select min(c1) from t1 having min(c1);


###删表删库
drop table if exists t1;
