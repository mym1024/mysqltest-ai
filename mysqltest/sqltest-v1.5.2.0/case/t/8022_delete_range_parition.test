###2-1:根据主键列删除操作
drop table if exists trange1;
create table trange1(c1 int, c2 int,primary key (c1)) partition by range columns(c1)(partition r0 values less than(20), partition r2 values less than maxvalue);
show table rules;
insert into trange1 values(1,1),(2,2),(3,3);
show tables;
show partition groups;

--real_sleep 3
delete from trange1 where c1 in(1);
delete from trange1 where c1 in(1,2);
delete from trange1 where c1>=3;
delete from trange1 where c1<=1;
delete from trange1 where 1>=c1;
delete from trange1 where 3<=c1;
delete from trange1 where c1>1 and c1<3;
delete from trange1 where c1=1 or c1=2;
delete from trange1 where c1<1 or c1<2;
#--error 145
delete from trange1 where c1=1 and c1=2;
delete from trange1 where c1>1 and c1=2;
select * from trange1;

###2-2:根据非主键列删除操作
drop table if exists trange1;
create table trange1(c1 int, c2 int,primary key (c1)) partition by range columns(c1)(partition r0 values less than(20), partition r2 values less than maxvalue);
show table rules;
insert into trange1 values(1,1),(2,2),(3,3);
show partition groups;

--real_sleep 3
delete from trange1 where c2 in(1);
delete from trange1 where c2 in(1,2);
delete from trange1 where c2>=3;
delete from trange1 where c2<=1;
delete from trange1 where 1>=c2;
delete from trange1 where 3<=c2;
delete from trange1 where c2>1 and c2<3;
delete from trange1 where c2=1 or c2=2;
delete from trange1 where c2<1 or c2<2;
delete from trange1 where c2=1 and c2=2;
delete from trange1 where c2>1 and c2=2;

###2-3:主键和非主键混合
drop table if exists trange1;
create table trange1(c1 int, c2 int,primary key (c1)) partition by range columns(c1)(partition r0 values less than(20), partition r2 values less than maxvalue);
show table rules;
insert into trange1 values(1,1),(2,2),(3,3);
show partition groups;

--real_sleep 3
delete from trange1 where (c1,c2) in((1,1));
delete from trange1 where (c1,c2) in((1,1),(2,2));
delete from trange1 where (c2,c1) in((1,1));
delete from trange1 where (c2,c1) in((1,1),(2,2));
delete from trange1 where c1>1 and c2>10 and c1=1;
select * from trange1;
delete from trange1 where c1>1 or c2>10 and c1=1;


###2-4:重复测试使用主键删除
drop table if exists trange1;
create table trange1(c1 int, c2 int,primary key (c1)) partition by range columns(c1)(partition r0 values less than(20), partition r2 values less than maxvalue);
show table rules;
insert into trange1 values(1,1),(2,2),(3,3);
show partition groups;

--real_sleep 3
delete from trange1 where c2<=1;
delete from trange1 where 1>=c2;
delete from trange1 where 3<=c2;
delete from trange1 where c2>1 and c2<3;
delete from trange1 where c2=1 or c2=2;
delete from trange1 where c2<1 or c2<2;
delete from trange1 where c2=1 and c2=2;
delete from trange1 where c2>1 and c2=2;
